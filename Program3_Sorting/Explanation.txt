Finding the Maximum

This part of the algorithm is straightforward. 
Each process finds its maximum number in constant time since the data is already sorted locally. 
Then the leader process collects one number from each process and finds the overall maximum. 
This takes O(M) time, where M is the number of processes, assuming the message passing and local computation are in constant time.
