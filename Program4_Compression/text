Tim finished doing the frequencies and tree, and now he's starting his compression and decompression.

Testability: He has a parameter to adjust the size (which is the longest path in the Huffman encoding). He also had a simple system where he could print out the bytes in original and compressed files 
and then the compression ratio. This made it easy to see that his code worked.

Correctness: Tim hasn't finished code for the decompressor yet so I can't measure his correctness.

Performance: Tim used the LZW encoding (also did Huffman) and I used Huffman Encoding. We compared our compression ratios (Tim's predicted compression ratio since he hasn't implemented the whole thing). 
We both downloaded "Pride and Prejudice." Tim got a ratio of 1.93 while I got a ratio of 1.83. 

Overall, Tim's code was very testable and clear, allowing us to easily compare results.
