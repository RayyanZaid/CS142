1 Thread  -- Version 1
2 Threads -- Version 1


TIME

First experiment

I've never done anything with parallelism before, so I just wanted to convince myself that having 2 threads 
is faster than 1.

When I measured of 1 thread and 2 threads initially, I was surprised to see that 1 thread was actually running faster.

That sparked my curiosity, so then I wanted to see the intersection point of when 2 threads becomes faster than 1 thread.
As you can see from Version1TimingIntersection.png, it's not really an exact intersection, but 2 threads tend to become faster
after pushing about 5000 elements

ACCURACY

First experiment:

For me, when N < 20, 2 threads add to the stack perfectly. 

However, once I tried inputs around 30, it started messing things up. Usually it wouldn't add elements.
But then, I tried 30 a couple minutes later and it was working perfectly. Why did that happen?
