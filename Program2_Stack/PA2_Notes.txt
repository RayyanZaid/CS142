PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT 2

3 Queues (Check the speed for each)

push numbers 1 -- 1,000,000

2 threads filling it with numbers (until something interesting happens)
write the interesting stuff in the comments during submission

1) No control (things can disapper or double when 2 threads access it)


2) Use Mutex to fix the problem from 1 
Mutex - allows solitary access to a block of code (should be no surprises) (it's safe)
Mutexes use locks
Issue: Could be slow

3) COMPARE AND SET: update head only if you know what the old head is (from picture). atomic instruction
    CAS (Compare and Swap)
TIPS: 

#include <atomic> -- for compare 
#include <mutex>
