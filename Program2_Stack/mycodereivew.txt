My code review partner was Chloe 
I measured her code through efficiency, code structure, accuracy (test cases), and testability. 

Here are my comments:  

Metric: Efficiency -- Chloe's code seems very efficient. She creates 3 different classes for each of the versions and uses all of them in the main function
Metric: Code Structure. Code has a very simple structure. There are concise print statements that print out what's happening.
Metric: Accuracy (Edge cases) : Chloe hasn't finished her code yet (she doesn't have 2 threads). I suggest using pthred or c++'s thread library and creating 2 different threads that push to the stack.
Metric : Testability : For testability,  when you're done you can create a for loop that loops up until N.

1) For each of the versions and threads, use a timing library (like chrono) to measure the time of the for loop and see how they compare to each other (make sure you save the results somewhere)
2) For accuracy, you can keep the number of elements constant and run it a certain amount of times and then track how many are correct.
