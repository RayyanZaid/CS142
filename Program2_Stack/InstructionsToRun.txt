For version 1 and 2, compile with : g++ mainVersion(1 or 2).cpp Stack.cpp Node.cpp

For version 3, go into the version3 folder and compile JUST with g++ mainVersion3.cpp. 

If you want to see a graph of the time:
1) call the timeTestGraph() function and change the range as you like
2) execute the c++ file (it should populate the textfile)
3) Go to the graphScript.py and change the name of plt.savefig()
