square root bit manipulation (first programming assignment)

ill-conditioned matrices
don't subtract numbers that are an order of magnitude different from each other (error)

Parallelism 

Where does parallelism happen?

Sharing (temporal parallelism) not gonna take about this
programs were stack of cards before

large independent datasets

adding up big chunks of numbers
divide amongst ppl (but distribution of numbers could be unequal, some ppl may finish faster)

there's still serial pieces to parallelism (the cost of distributing numbers or thread ids)

any extra work kills the available parallelism you have

lockless methods communication patterns
